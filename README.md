## About The Project
This project can help people organize their exercise schedules, creating routines where they can put together all their favoritesâ€™ exercises on a weekly format and make available a place to search and even propose new exercises in order to increase the content of the website. On a technical level the project implements a responsive interface, making smoother the user experience through mobile devices, it also implements API rest calls for database usage on some crucial functionalities, enabling a more transparent experience.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
The complexity of this website comes from concepts and tools that are uncommon or not even present on the previous projects: **Django REST Framework, @media annotations on the CSS files (allowing the responsiveness) and the implementation of triggers on the database**

### Django REST Framework
The implementation of this tool allows to interact with the database on an asynchronous way, enable performance multiple edition operations by user without refreshing the page. These methods are define on the <em>view.py</em> file.
The URLs are use by Ajax/Js to perform List, Update and Delete Operations:
* 'List':'/list_exercise_routine/<int:pk>/'
* 'UpdatePosition':'/update_exercise_routine_position/<int:pk>/'
* 'UpdateRepetition':'/update_exercise_routine_repetition/<int:pk>/'
* 'Delete':'/delete_exercise_routine/<int:pk>/'


### @media
This tool is implemented on the CSS files and complement the nav bar and index page (<em>style_explore.css, style_head.css and style.css</em>) allowing to adjust the style base on the size of the user screen

### Triggers
The database website use triggers to manipulate data associated with video and video-cover consumption from youtube:
```
CREATE TRIGGER id_excercise_video 
   AFTER INSERT ON excercise_exercise
BEGIN
	UPDATE excercise_exercise
	SET id_link_video = SUBSTR(link_video,INSTR(link_video,'=') + 1, LENGTH(link_video))
	WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM excercise_exercise);
END;
```

## Content of each file
### HTML
#### Index.html
This view contains all the routines created by the current user and display them on a weekly format, it also gives access to another view to create a new routine or to click over a routine to see its details.

### CSS
